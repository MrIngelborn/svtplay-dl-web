## Download

You can download the latest release [here](https://svtplay-dl.se/archive/). Unzip and run svtplay-dl.exe from a command prompt.

Then you should download [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip) and put `ffmpeg.exe` in the same folder as `svtplay-dl.exe`.
if you do that it will merge audio and video file into one file.


_If you'd like the latest bleeding edge build from the current [master](https://github.com/spaam/svtplay-dl), you'll find it here:_

[https://svtplay-dl.se/download/snapshots/](https://svtplay-dl.se/download/snapshots/).
