<h2>Installation</h2>

<h3>Mac OSX</h3>

<p>If you have OS X and <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> you can install with:</p>

<pre><code>brew install svtplay-dl</code></pre>

<h3>Debian and Ubuntu</h3>

<p>svtplay-dl is available in Debian in Jessie and later and Ubuntu
in 14.04 and later, which means you can install it using apt:</p>

<pre><code>apt-get install svtplay-dl</code></pre>

<p>... as root.</p>
or use <a href="https://apt.svtplay-dl.se/">which includes newer versions for debian/ubuntu</a>

<h3>Other systems with python</h3>

<pre><code>pip install svtplay-dl</code></pre>
<h3>From source</h3>

<p>If packaging isn't available for your operating system, or you
want to use a non-released version, you'll want to install from
source. Use git to download the sources:</p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/spaam/svtplay-dl</code></pre>

<p>svtplay-dl requires the following additional tools and libraries.
They are usually available from your distribution's package
repositories. If you don't have them, some features will not be
working.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://rtmpdump.mplayerhq.hu/">RTMPDump</a> 2.4 or higher to
download RTMP streams.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">PyCrypto</a> to
download encrypted HLS streams</li>
<li><a href="http://www.python-requests.org/">requests</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> or <a href="http://libav.org">Libav</a> for postprocessing and/or for DASH streams</li>
</ul>

<p>To install it, run</p>

<pre><code>make

# as root:
make install
# On systems with 2.7.8 or older we need the security packges with requests
pip install requests[security]
</code></pre>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>If you have windows you can download an <a href="/archive">.exe file</a> instead of installing python and all other deps to run the script</p>
<p>i recommend downloading <a href="https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/">FFmpeg</a> or <a href="http://builds.libav.org/windows/">Libav</a>
unpack the archive and put the files in the bin directory in the same folder as svtplay-dl.exe</p>
