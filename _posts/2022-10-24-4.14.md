* pluto.tv: improved detection of season and episode number
* pluto.tv: improved ad detection
* tv4play: they changed their site
* tv4play: show an error message when geoblocked instead of crashing on retries, because they send 5xx error message instead of 4xx one
* nrk: should work again
* urplay: support for only audio files
* windows: fixed so it works with windows 7 (time to upgrade...)
* added a new argument `--filename` so you dont have to use config file to access it
