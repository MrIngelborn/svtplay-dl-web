* New mayor release that is python3 *only*
* Changed the way we distribute windows binaries which means no false positive warnings from anti-virus
* * the windows binary is in a zip file now with a bunch of files which we need.
* Replaced pycrypto to use pycryptodome. pycrypto is old and buggy
* Added a new dependency pyyaml for config file feature
* tv4play: should work again after they changed their site.
* dplay: support for subtitles and download all different subtitles.
