* svtplay added support for `dolby vision` and `4K` videos few days ago.
* Add support for downloading `dolby vision` videos when specify `--format dvhevc` (you can see what videos codecs videos have with `--list-quality`)
> * You can specify `--format dvhevc-51,dvhevc,hevc-51,hevc` to only get videos with `dolby vision` with and without 5.1 sound and `hevc` with and without 5.1 sound.  by default svtplay-dl only download h264-51 and h264.
* Add support for `<`, `<=`, `>` and `>=` in `--resolution`
> * By default svtplay-dl will download the video with highest bitrate. it could be the 4k video one.
> * In case you down want that you can use this feature like this:
> * `--resolution "<720"` will download videos with a resolution less than 720p for example 480p
> * `--resolution ">=1080"`  will download videos that is 1080p or bigger.
> * I recommend adding this to your [config](/config/) so you dont have to specify it all the time
