* svtplay: when we have both subtitles `svenska` and `svenska (allt tal)` it will only download `allt tal`
* svtplay: fixed -A on `kategorier`
* svtplay: improve detection on season info based on year

* added support for svtbarn
* tv4play: fixed a crash on downloading clips
* fixed a crash on bad filenames on windows with `:` in the name
* changed how configs works.
- it will check current working directory first for the file `svtplay-dl.yaml`
    - then on windows the `%APPDATA%\svtplay-dl\svtplay-dl.yaml` file
    - on *nix then `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/svtplay-dl/svtplay.yaml` / `~/.config/svtplay-dl/svtplay-dl.yaml` then the old `~/.svtplay-dl.yaml`
