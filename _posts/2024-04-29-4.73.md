* svtplay: fix crash on some clips
* removed --audio-role (all the interesting audio is in the --audio-language)
* added --video-role. works like --audio-role. but with some improvement. for example `alternate-sign` role for `teckenspr√•kstolkat`. some downloaded videos in 4.71 and 4.72 might have gotten the wrong video because of this....
* added `-R` for reversed download order with `-A`. thanks to @ml-1
